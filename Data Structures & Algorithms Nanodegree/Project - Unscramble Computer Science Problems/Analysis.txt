Big O Analysis

Task 0: 
	- O(1)
	- The function is independent of the input.
	
Task 1: 
	- O(n)
	- The function depends on the number of records in the both datasets thus having a linear time.

Task 2: 
	- O(n)
	- The function depends on the number of calls thus having a linear time.
	
Task 3: 
	- O(nlog(n))
	- There are two loops that depend on the number of calls thus having a linear time O(2n). It also sorts the results thus having O(nlog(n)). Combining them would give O(nlog(n) + 2n). But it can be simplified to O(nlog(n)).

Task 4: 
	- O(nlog(n))
	- There are two loops that depend on the number of calls thus having a linear time O(2n). It also sorts the results thus having O(nlog(n)). Combining them would give O(nlog(n) + 2n). But it can be simplified to O(nlog(n)).
