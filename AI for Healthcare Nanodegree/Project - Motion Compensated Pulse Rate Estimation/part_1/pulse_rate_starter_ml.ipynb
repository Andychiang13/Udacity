    "        - The capillaries in the wrist are filled with blood when the ventricles contract.\n",
    "        - When there are few red blood cells in these capillaries, the light from the PPG sensor will be reflected in a large amount. \n",
    "        - When the blood cells are many, they absorb the light, so the optical detector will detect less light.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    5. Common failure modes: \n",
    "        - The algorithm may not perform well in other stages of changing heart rate due to arm and hand movements.\n",
    "        - The length of records in data files are not equal.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- **Algorithm Performance**\n",
    "    - The performance is calculated using the mean absolute error between the estimations and the ground truth signal.\n",
    "    - To limit the noise coming from hand and arm movements, I used the acceleration magnitude. Also, the accelerometer magnitude is close to 1 g, which means the total force on the accelerometer is only due to gravity. But if you look at the individual channels, they shift around.\n",
    "    - One can use other metrics like accuracy, recall, percision, f1-score.\n",
